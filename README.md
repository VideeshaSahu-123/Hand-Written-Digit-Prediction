# HAND-WRITTEN-DIGIT-PREDICTION

Handwritten digit prediction is a classic problem in computer vision and machine learning. It involves training a model to accurately recognize handwritten digits from images.

#  ABSTRACT

Handwritten Digit Recognition is a pivotal task in computer vision, with applications spanning from optical character recognition to form processing. 
This project aims to develop a robust and accurate model capable of identifying handwritten digits from images.

By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 
we propose a framework that can effectively extract relevant features from handwritten digit images and classify them with high precision. 
Our model incorporates data augmentation strategies to enhance generalization and address the challenges posed by variations in handwriting styles and image quality.

Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. 
Our research contributes to the advancement of handwritten digit recognition technology, paving the way for more efficient and accurate automation in various real-world applications.
